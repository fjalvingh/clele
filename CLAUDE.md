# Clele — Electronic Parts Stock Management

Full-stack web app for managing electronic component inventory with AI-powered part lookup.

## Build & Run

Frontend and backend ship as a **single web container**: the Maven build compiles the React/Vite
app and bundles it into the Spring Boot jar, which serves the UI and the `/api` on the same port.

- **Production build (one jar serving both)**: `mvn21 package` from `backend/` — the
  `frontend-maven-plugin` downloads a private Node into `backend/target`, runs `npm install` +
  `npm run build` (in `../frontend`), and `maven-resources-plugin` copies `frontend/dist` into the
  jar's `static/`. Run with `java -jar target/parts-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` → everything on port 8080.
- **Run the merged app from source**: `mvn21 spring-boot:run` from `backend/` builds the frontend
  too and serves it from `static/` (port 8080).
- **Fast backend-only run** (skip the npm build): `mvn21 spring-boot:run -DskipFrontend=true`
- **Frontend hot-reload dev**: `npm install && npm run dev` from `frontend/` — Vite dev server on
  port 5173 proxies `/api` to the backend on 8080. Use this alongside `-DskipFrontend=true`.
- **Frontend build check**: `npm run build` from `frontend/` (must be in that directory, not project root)
- **SPA routing**: `config/SpaWebConfig` serves static files when present and falls back to
  `index.html` for non-`/api` paths so BrowserRouter deep links / refreshes work.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Spring Boot 3.2.3, Java 21, PostgreSQL, Flyway, Spring Data JPA, Springdoc OpenAPI, Lombok
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript, Vite 7, React Router 7, Tailwind CSS 4, Axios 1.x

## Database

- PostgreSQL: database `partsdb`, user `partsuser`, password `partspass`
- Schema managed by Flyway migrations (V1–V7) in `backend/src/main/resources/db/migration/`
  - V5 added `part.footprint/mpn/octopart_id` columns and the `stock_movement` ledger table
  - V6 added `spec_definition.json_name` (machine key matching `part.specs` JSON keys), dropped
    the unique constraint on `name`, and wiped the old (mismatched) spec_definition records
  - V7 seeds a standard Octopart/Digi-Key-style category taxonomy (~157 rows, 2–3 levels:
    Passives, Semiconductors→ICs→Logic/Analog/Power/MCU/Memory/Interface/Clock/RF,
    Optoelectronics, Connectors, Electromechanical, Sensors, Power, Cables, Hardware, Modules).
    Fresh-replace: it deletes the old ad-hoc demo/test category rows (safe — no part referenced a
    category) and inserts the tree with explicit ids, then realigns `category_id_seq`. The manual
    `db/seed_74xx.sql` is now superseded for categories (its 74xx tree lives under ICs→Logic ICs)
- `ddl-auto: validate` — every schema change requires a new Flyway migration
- Hibernate 6 + PostgreSQL: use plain `byte[]` with `columnDefinition = "bytea"` — do NOT use `@Lob` (maps to OID, which is wrong)

## Key Patterns & Gotchas

- **Axios client** (`api/client.ts`) sets default `Content-Type: application/json` and converts all errors to `new Error(message)` via interceptor. In catch blocks use `(err as Error).message`, never `err.response.status`. For multipart uploads, explicitly override the Content-Type header.
- **TypeScript** `verbatimModuleSyntax` is enabled — use `import { type Foo }` for type-only imports
- **Global exception handler** returns errors under key `"error"` (not `"message"`)
- **Flyway**: `flyway-core` alone handles PostgreSQL in Flyway 9.x — do not add `flyway-database-postgresql` (not managed by Spring Boot 3.2 BOM)
- **Multipart upload limit**: 10MB configured in `application.yml`
- **Image proxy** (`/api/image-proxy?url=`): proxies external images through the backend with browser-like headers. Accepts any HTTP(S) host. Used by Quick Add to avoid CORS and Cloudflare bot-protection issues.

## Partsbox Import

- Java CLI tool that loads a [Partsbox](https://partsbox.com) **WebSocket capture** into Clele.
  Package `com.clele.parts.imports`: `PartsboxImportRunner` (`ApplicationRunner`, active
  only under the `import` profile) + `PartsboxImportService` + `PartsboxTransitReader`.
- **Source = `data.txt`**, a capture of Partsbox's Sente (`/chsk`) WebSocket messages, which
  are **Transit+JSON**. The `core/initial-data` frame for table `:parts` holds the full
  *enriched* record for every part — far more than the plain JSON export (which lacks
  descriptions, real manufacturers, datasheets, specs, images). Decoded via the
  `com.cognitect:transit-java` dependency (version pinned in `pom.xml`; not in the Spring BOM).

### Capturing `data.txt` from Partsbox

Partsbox has no rich export, so the data is captured from the live web app's WebSocket:

1. Log in to [partsbox.com](https://partsbox.com) in Chrome and open the parts list.
2. Open DevTools (F12) → **Network** tab → filter **WS** → reload the page so the socket
   reconnects. Click the **`chsk`** WebSocket entry, then its **Messages** tab.
3. Partsbox pushes the catalogue on connect as `core/initial-data` frames (one per table:
   `:parts`, `:storage`, …). The `:parts` frame is the large one (~2 MB).
4. Select all received (↓) messages in the Messages pane and copy them into `data.txt` at
   the repo root. Each line is `<transit-payload>\t<bytecount>` with a timestamp line
   between frames; `PartsboxTransitReader` tolerates that framing and ignores non-`core/
   initial-data` lines, so a full copy of the message log is fine. Re-sent duplicate frames
   are deduped by `part/id`.
- Run it (Flyway runs first, then it imports and exits — `application-import.yml` sets
  `web-application-type: none`):
  ```
  cd backend
  mvn21 spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=import \
    -Dspring-boot.run.arguments=--partsbox.file=../data.txt
  ```
- **Two phases**: (1) `@Transactional` load — wipe (`stock_movement`, `stock_entry`,
  `part_image`, `part`; keeps categories/specs/locations) then parts + stock; (2) image
  download outside that transaction (each `PartImageService.uploadFromUrl` is its own tx),
  tolerating individual failures. Idempotent / re-runnable.
- Mapping: `part/name` → unique `part_number` (duplicate names merged into one part);
  `:storage` rows → `location` (find-or-create by name). Enriched fields → `description`
  (part/description → octopart `main-description` fallback), `manufacturer`, `mpn`,
  `footprint`, `octopart_id`, `datasheet_url` (first `:datasheets`), and `specs` JSONB
  (octopart `:specs`, flattening `{v}` / `{minv,maxv}`). Octopart + SnapMagic image URLs are
  downloaded into `part_image` (≤5). Each `part/stock` transaction → a `stock_movement` row;
  `stock_entry` is the per-part/location on-hand aggregate (Σ movements, last positive price).
  Empty strings import as NULL.
- **Expected results** (current `data.txt`): 1064 parts, 1169 stock movements, 1051 stock
  entries, on-hand sum 15116; ~925 images downloaded, ~368 image failures. Image failures are
  normal and non-fatal — Partsbox's CDN returns `403 AccessDenied` for some objects, and
  SnapMagic returns gzip'd HTML placeholders (HTTP 200, not an image) where it has no photo.

## Stock Model

- `stock_entry` = on-hand aggregate (one row per part+location; read by dashboard,
  low-stock, part-detail). `stock_movement` = ledger of individual movements (history).
  The importer writes both; manual stock edits currently only touch `stock_entry`.

## AI Integration

- Provider: Anthropic Claude (model configured in `application.yml`, default `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`)
- `AiPartSearchService` calls the Anthropic Messages API via RestTemplate (no SDK dependency)
- `DuckDuckGoImageService` searches for part images via DuckDuckGo
- The AI system prompt is built dynamically from `spec_definition` table — each spec's `json_name` (the exact key) plus its title, type, unit, and SELECT options are included so the AI returns specs using exact `part.specs` JSON keys for automatic pre-fill
- AI response parser handles: clean JSON, markdown-fenced JSON, and prose text preceding JSON (extracts from first `[` or ` ``` ` fence)
- **Local AI (Ollama) for part auto-categorization** — separate from the cloud Anthropic path,
  fully offline. Config: `ollama.base-url` (default `http://localhost:11434`) + `ollama.model`
  (default `qwen2.5:7b-instruct`) in `application.yml`; uses a dedicated `ollamaRestTemplate` bean (120s read).
  `PartCategorizationService` runs a single background job (own daemon thread, guarded by an
  `AtomicBoolean`): it derives the **leaf categories** (those that are not any other category's
  parent) with their breadcrumb paths, then for each part calls Ollama `/api/chat`
  (`format:"json"`, `temperature:0`) to pick a `categoryId`, validates it against the leaf set, and
  saves it in a per-part transaction (invalid/null choices leave the part unchanged). Endpoints:
  `POST /api/parts/auto-categorize` (start, 409 if already running) and
  `GET /api/parts/auto-categorize/status` (progress: total/processed/assigned/skipped/lastError).
  The Parts page has an "Auto-categorize (AI)" button that starts the job and polls status.

## Key Features

- **CRUD** for parts, categories (hierarchical), locations, stock entries
- **Dashboard** with low stock alerts
- **Quick Add wizard** (3-step): AI part search → select result → confirm details + stock entry
  - AI returns specs keyed by each spec definition's `jsonName` → auto-fills spec fields in the confirm step
  - Image picker fetches suggestions via DuckDuckGo, displays through backend proxy, uploads selected images as multipart blobs (client-side fetch + multipart upload to avoid Cloudflare/CORS issues)
  - Shows error feedback if image uploads fail (with link to navigate to saved part)
  - Location field defaults to last used location (persisted in `localStorage` key `quickadd.lastLocationId`)
- **Part images**: upload/delete photos per part (max 5), stored as PNG BYTEA in DB
- **Spec definitions**: configurable specification fields (text, number, boolean, select) with units; can be associated with categories
  - Each definition has a `jsonName` (the exact key stored inside `part.specs`) separate from its
    human-readable `name`/title. All matching (AI prompt, Quick Add, Parts edit, Part detail) keys off `jsonName`
  - **"Rescan from parts"** (`POST /api/spec-definitions/rescan`, button on the Spec Definitions page):
    scans every part's `specs` JSON and upserts a definition per distinct key, inferring the data type
    and possible values. Upsert by `jsonName` preserves manually-edited title/unit while refreshing the
    inferred dataType/options. Inference: all-boolean → BOOLEAN; all-numeric → NUMBER; string set ≤30
    distinct with no digit-bearing value → SELECT (values become options); else TEXT
  - New definitions get a default title from `SpecNameHumanizer` — it splits separators + camelCase,
    then word-segments lowercase-concatenated keys (e.g. `numberofbits` → "Number of Bits") against a
    curated electronics vocabulary, applying an acronym map (DC, I2C, RoHS, …). Unknown tokens fall back
    to a single capitalized word
- **Part detail page**: image gallery on left, details on right; thumbnail strip; per-location stock
  entries with unit price; total on-hand quantity + total stock value summary; a collapsible
  "Stock Movements" history (ledger sorted newest-first, showing quantity, location, price, comments,
  timestamp, and who made the move) backed by `GET /parts/{id}/movements`
